# Neos Federated Token (NFT)

This is a community-driven token created specifically for the NeosVR community. The Neos Federated Token (NFT) is designed to offer a versatile method for the exchange of goods, services, and digital assets within the NeosVR Platform.

The NFT is not only a means of transaction, but a platform for community interaction. By design, the management and control of the token contract lies in the hands of the community. This empowers NeosVR users to actively participate in shaping the economy of their shared virtual space.

As we move forward, we are committed to implementing new features and enhancements as requested by the community. We value our community's feedback and look forward to using this platform to bring everyone closer in the NeosVR Platform.

Feel free to explore, contribute and shape the future of your virtual space!
